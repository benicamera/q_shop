# qShop

qShop is a shopping list app written in Dart using Flutter framework.
It was a project in high school computer science basics.

It's buggy and more like a truck made out of unfitting spare parts ;-)
In addition to that, the API of the neural network in the cloud is no longer running.

We recommend using Bring!
